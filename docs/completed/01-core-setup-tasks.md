## 1A. Additional Setup Tasks (Addendum) ðŸ”„ âœ…
*Unplanned tasks added during implementation - addressing technical debt and tooling improvements*

> **Note**: Tasks 1.5-1.11 and 1A.1 were not in the original Phase 1 plan but became necessary due to:
> - Framework stability concerns (Elysia â†’ Hono migration)
> - Performance optimizations (ioredis â†’ node-redis migration)  
> - Code quality improvements (ESLint/Prettier â†’ Biome 2.x migration)
> - Project rebranding (cisco-quiz-app â†’ CertQuiz)
> - Code structure alignment with Phase 1 architecture
> - Test configuration issues (duplication, inconsistencies)
> - CI/CD foundation setup for development efficiency

### 1.5 Rename Project to CertQuiz âœ…
**Time**: 15 minutes
**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Reason**: Project rebranding for clearer scope definition
```bash
# Tasks:
- Rename project from cisco-quiz-app to CertQuiz
- Update all references in documentation
- Update package.json project names
- Update README.md with new project name
- Test: Project builds and runs with new name
```

### 1.6 Migrate from Elysia to Hono âœ…
**Time**: 2 hours
**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Reason**: Framework stability and better TypeScript support
```bash
# Tasks:
- Replace Elysia with Hono in package.json dependencies
- Migrate route definitions from Elysia syntax to Hono syntax
- Update middleware implementations for Hono
- Migrate validation from Elysia's t.Object to Zod schemas
- Update all test files to use Hono test utilities
- Update documentation references from Elysia to Hono
- Test: All routes work with Hono, tests pass
```

### 1.7 Migrate from ioredis to node-redis âœ…
**Time**: 2 hours
**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Reason**: Performance optimization and reduced dependencies
```bash
# Tasks:
- Replace ioredis with redis package in dependencies
- Update Redis configuration to use node-redis v4 API
- Migrate all Redis commands to new syntax patterns
- Update TypeScript types from Redis to RedisClientType
- Fix integration tests and streamline performance tests
- Test: All Redis functionality works, 77/77 tests pass
```

### 1.8 Migrate to Biome 2.x âœ…
**Time**: 1.5 hours
**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Reason**: Unified linting/formatting tool for improved developer experience
```bash
# Tasks:
- Remove ESLint and Prettier dependencies
- Install Biome as dev dependency in root package.json
- Create biome.json with Biome 2.x configuration format
- Update package.json scripts to use Biome commands
- Configure VS Code settings for Biome extension
- Test: All formatting and linting works with Biome
```

### 1.9 Reorganize API Code Structure âœ…
**Time**: 1 hour (Actual: 1.5 hours)
**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Reason**: Align code structure with Phase 1 module-based architecture before CI/CD setup
```bash
# Tasks:
- Create modules/ directory structure
- Move routes/health.ts to modules/health/health.routes.ts
- Move routes/health.test.ts to modules/health/health.routes.test.ts
- Create shared/ directory for shared utilities
- Move lib/logger.ts to shared/logger.ts
- Move config/redis.ts to shared/cache.ts
- Create placeholder files for shared/result.ts, shared/errors.ts, shared/types.ts
- Move integration/ tests to tests/integration/
- Remove obsolete directories (core/, lib/)
- Update all import paths
- Test: All tests pass with new structure (60/60 tests passing)
```

### 1.10 Centralize Test Environment Configuration âœ…
**Time**: 2 hours  
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Reason**: Eliminate test environment duplication and resolve bun test inconsistencies
```bash
# Tasks:
- Create single source of truth for test environment variables (test-env.ts)
- Add automatic test isolation via vitest.setup.ts
- Refactor env.test.ts to use centralized configuration  
- Simplify env-proxy.test.ts by removing manual environment setup
- Eliminate code duplication between vitest.config.ts and test files
- Follow o3's recommendation for clean test environment management
- Test: All tests use consistent environment setup
```

### 1.11 Resolve Test Duplication and Vitest Configuration âœ…
**Time**: 1.5 hours
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Reason**: Fix bun test vs bun run test inconsistency and proper monorepo configuration
```bash
# Tasks:
- Create root vitest.config.ts with proper project configuration
- Fix apps/api/vitest.config.ts to use defineProject() for monorepo
- Move integration tests to tests/integration/ directory (outside src/)
- Remove duplicate test file from src/tests/integration/
- Add setupFiles configuration to all test projects
- Resolve bun test vs bun run test inconsistency (127 vs 60 tests)
- Archive old test files to prevent Bun discovery
- Follow o3's guidance for proper Bun + Vitest monorepo setup
- Test: Both commands run same 60 tests consistently
```

### 1A.1 Setup GitHub Actions CI/CD Foundation âœ…
**Time**: 3-4 hours (Actual: ~3 hours)
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Reason**: Early CI/CD setup for development efficiency and quality gates
```yaml
# Tasks:
- Create basic CI workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
- Implement lint + typecheck + unit test pipeline
- Add Docker build and smoke test validation - docker-build job implemented
- Configure branch protection rules (CI green required) - Rulesets enabled
- Setup aggressive caching strategy for <5min PR feedback
- Add basic dependency security scanning - bun audit implemented
- Test: PR checks complete in under 5 minutes - Validated with 61 passing tests
```

**Note**: All Phase A requirements completed. CodeQL deferred until after business logic implementation (recommended after Task 2.1).

## Summary Statistics

- **Total Tasks**: 12 (4 planned + 8 additional)
- **Total Time**: ~17 hours (vs 1.5 hours originally planned)
- **Major Achievements**:
  - Complete monorepo structure with Bun workspaces
  - Docker environment with PostgreSQL, KeyCloak, and Redis
  - Framework migration to stable stack (Hono + node-redis)
  - Modern tooling (Biome 2.x)
  - Full CI/CD pipeline with <5min PR feedback
  - 61 tests passing consistently
