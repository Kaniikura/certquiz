# Implementation Task List - Phase 1 (Vertical Slice Architecture)

## Overview

This document breaks down Phase 1 implementation into manageable tasks using Vertical Slice Architecture (VSA) with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. Each task should be completed with tests before moving to the next.

**Phase 1 Goal**: Basic quiz functionality with authentication and admin features using VSA, where each feature is organized as a complete vertical slice containing all layers.

## Task Organization

- 🔴 **Blocker**: Must be completed before dependent tasks
- 🟡 **High Priority**: Core functionality
- 🟢 **Normal Priority**: Can be done in parallel
- ⏱️ **Estimated Time**: Rough estimate for completion
- ✅ **Completed**: Task finished

## 2.1 Remove Cache Infrastructure ✅
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Time**: 1.5 hours (actual: ~1 hour)
**Priority**: HIGH
**Reason**: Using Neon database which provides built-in connection pooling and scaling

### Completed Tasks:
```typescript
// Redis/Cache Removal:
✅ Remove Redis from docker-compose.yml
✅ Delete apps/api/src/shared/cache.ts and cache.test.ts
✅ Remove cache references from shared utilities
✅ Update environment variables (remove REDIS_URL)

// Module Updates:
✅ Remove caching from quiz.service.ts (Task 7.1)
✅ Remove caching from question retrieval (Task 5.4)
✅ Remove session caching references
✅ Update all import statements

// Documentation Updates:
✅ Update CLAUDE.md to reflect Neon usage
✅ Update project-structure.md
✅ Update coding-standards.md
✅ Remove cache-related patterns

// Test Updates:
✅ Remove all cache-related tests
✅ Update integration tests to not expect caching
✅ Verify all tests pass without Redis (157 tests passing)
```

### Rationale:
- **Neon provides connection pooling**: Built-in multiplexing eliminates traditional RDB connection bottlenecks
- **PostgreSQL has native caching**: Shared buffers and OS cache handle repeated queries efficiently
- **Drizzle ORM is cache-free by design**: Keeps code simple and maintainable
- **Premature caching adds complexity**: Cache invalidation and fallback logic increase operational overhead

## 3. Database Foundation ✅
**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Total Time**: ~10 hours (6.5 planned + 3.5 additional)  
**Completion Date**: July 12, 2025  

### Summary
Complete database foundation with VSA architecture implementation:
- ✅ **Drizzle ORM Setup**: Type-safe database layer with connection pooling
- ✅ **Core Schema**: 18 tables with PostgreSQL advanced features (JSONB, arrays, enums)
- ✅ **VSA Migration**: Clean-slate architecture reset to Vertical Slice Architecture
- ✅ **Infrastructure**: Middleware stack, unit-of-work, health endpoint
- ✅ **Migration System**: Full rollback capability with security validation
- ✅ **Test Infrastructure**: Testcontainers with transaction isolation
- ✅ **CI Integration**: Automated migration testing with GitHub Actions

**Key Achievements**:
- VSA architecture with first vertical slice (health endpoint) operational
- Production-ready database layer with graceful shutdown and monitoring
- Comprehensive migration system with Bun-native execution
- 40+ tests covering all components with 90%+ coverage
- Security hardening with path traversal and SQL injection protection

## Revised Timeline (VSA + Repository Pattern)

**Note**: Timeline updated to reflect VSA + Repository Pattern architecture with clean-slate rewrite and reordered tasks.

- **Week 1**: Tasks 1 + 2 (Core Setup + Shared Utilities) ✅
- **Week 2**: Tasks 3.1-3.7 (Database Foundation + VSA Migration)
  - Day 1-2: Clean-slate reset & infrastructure foundation ✅
  - Day 3-4: First vertical slice (Health) ✅
  - Day 5: Quality Gates setup
- **Week 3**: Tasks 4 + 5.1-5.3 (Quality Gates + Domain Design + Auth + Migrations)
  - Day 1: Quality Gates
  - Day 2-3: Quiz domain model & repository
  - Day 4: Auth slice with minimal User aggregate
  - Day 5: Migrations and seed data
- **Week 4**: Tasks 5.4-6 (Quiz Features + User/Question Features + API Layer)
  - Day 1-2: Quiz feature slices with TDD
  - Day 3: User domain evolution & features
  - Day 4: Question features
  - Day 5: API layer completion
- **Week 5**: Tasks 7-9 (Basic Features + Frontend Foundation + Core UI)
- **Week 6**: Tasks 10-12 (Admin Interface + Testing + DevOps)

**Architecture Migration Summary**:
- Clean-slate approach (no gradual migration)
- Repository pattern for persistence isolation
- Unit-of-Work via Drizzle transactions
- Domain-first development with 90% coverage target
- Vertical slices with co-located tests

Total estimate: ~100-120 hours of development time (includes repository pattern overhead but cleaner architecture)

## Critical Path

The following tasks are on the critical path and block other work:
1. Shared Utilities (blocks feature development) ✅
2. Database Foundation (blocks all data operations) ✅
3. Clean-Slate Architecture Reset (blocks VSA implementation) ✅
4. Infrastructure Foundation (blocks all features) ✅
5. First Vertical Slice (validates architecture) ✅
6. Quality Gates (establishes code quality standards) 🟡
7. Domain/Repository Implementation (blocks business logic) 🟡
8. API Layer (blocks frontend integration) 🟡

## Risk Mitigation

- **Performance Risk**: Repository pattern adds minimal overhead, mitigated by Drizzle's efficiency
- **Complexity Risk**: Start with simple domain models, evolve as business rules emerge
- **Testing Risk**: 90% domain coverage enforced from day one
- **Migration Risk**: Clean-slate approach with legacy branch backup
- **Team Risk**: Kick-off workshop + code review templates for VSA understanding

## VSA Implementation Notes

### Repository Pattern Guidelines
1. **Interface in domain layer**: `features/[bc]/domain/repositories/I[Entity]Repository.ts`
2. **Implementation alongside**: `features/[bc]/domain/repositories/Drizzle[Entity]Repository.ts`
3. **Transaction via closure**: All handlers use `withTransaction(async trx => {...})`
4. **No cross-slice imports**: ESLint boundaries enforced

### Testing Strategy
1. **Domain tests**: Pure unit tests, no DB, 90% coverage
2. **Repository tests**: SQLite in-memory adapter
3. **Handler tests**: Mock repositories, test business flow
4. **Contract tests**: Full HTTP tests with real DB

### Development Flow
1. Write failing handler test
2. Create domain entities/VOs as needed
3. Define repository interface
4. Implement repository with Drizzle
5. Wire up handler with transaction
6. Create route with validation
7. Run contract test end-to-end
