## 2.1 Remove Cache Infrastructure ✅
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Time**: 1.5 hours (actual: ~1 hour)
**Priority**: HIGH
**Reason**: Using Neon database which provides built-in connection pooling and scaling

### Completed Tasks:
```typescript
// Redis/Cache Removal:
✅ Remove Redis from docker-compose.yml
✅ Delete apps/api/src/shared/cache.ts and cache.test.ts
✅ Remove cache references from shared utilities
✅ Update environment variables (remove REDIS_URL)

// Module Updates:
✅ Remove caching from quiz.service.ts (Task 7.1)
✅ Remove caching from question retrieval (Task 5.4)
✅ Remove session caching references
✅ Update all import statements

// Documentation Updates:
✅ Update CLAUDE.md to reflect Neon usage
✅ Update project-structure.md
✅ Update coding-standards.md
✅ Remove cache-related patterns

// Test Updates:
✅ Remove all cache-related tests
✅ Update integration tests to not expect caching
✅ Verify all tests pass without Redis (157 tests passing)
```

### Rationale:
- **Neon provides connection pooling**: Built-in multiplexing eliminates traditional RDB connection bottlenecks
- **PostgreSQL has native caching**: Shared buffers and OS cache handle repeated queries efficiently
- **Drizzle ORM is cache-free by design**: Keeps code simple and maintainable
- **Premature caching adds complexity**: Cache invalidation and fallback logic increase operational overhead

**Architecture Migration Summary**:
- Clean-slate approach (no gradual migration)
- Repository pattern for persistence isolation
- Unit-of-Work via Drizzle transactions
- Domain-first development with 90% coverage target
- Vertical slices with co-located tests

Total estimate: ~100-120 hours of development time (includes repository pattern overhead but cleaner architecture)

## Critical Path

The following tasks are on the critical path and block other work:
1. Shared Utilities (blocks feature development) ✅
2. Database Foundation (blocks all data operations) ✅
3. Clean-Slate Architecture Reset (blocks VSA implementation) ✅
4. Infrastructure Foundation (blocks all features) ✅
5. First Vertical Slice (validates architecture) ✅
6. Quality Gates (establishes code quality standards) ✅
7. Domain/Repository Implementation (blocks business logic) ✅
8. **Provider Field Rename (blocks clean domain model)** ✅
9. **Logging Infrastructure (essential for debugging)** ✅
10. **Authentication Middleware (required before production)** ✅
11. **Migration and Seed System (enables development database)** ✅
12. **Quiz Feature Slices (core business logic)** ✅

## Risk Mitigation

- **Performance Risk**: Repository pattern adds minimal overhead, mitigated by Drizzle's efficiency
- **Complexity Risk**: Start with simple domain models, evolve as business rules emerge
- **Testing Risk**: 90% domain coverage enforced from day one
- **Migration Risk**: Clean-slate approach with legacy branch backup
- **Team Risk**: Kick-off workshop + code review templates for VSA understanding

## VSA Implementation Notes

### Repository Pattern Guidelines
1. **Interface in domain layer**: `features/[bc]/domain/repositories/I[Entity]Repository.ts`
2. **Implementation alongside**: `features/[bc]/domain/repositories/Drizzle[Entity]Repository.ts`
3. **Transaction via closure**: All handlers use `withTransaction(async trx => {...})`
4. **No cross-slice imports**: ESLint boundaries enforced

### Testing Strategy
1. **Domain tests**: Pure unit tests, no DB, 90% coverage
2. **Repository tests**: SQLite in-memory adapter
3. **Handler tests**: Mock repositories, test business flow
4. **Contract tests**: Full HTTP tests with real DB

### Development Flow
1. Write failing handler test
2. Create domain entities/VOs as needed
3. Define repository interface
4. Implement repository with Drizzle
5. Wire up handler with transaction
6. Create route with validation
7. Run contract test end-to-end
