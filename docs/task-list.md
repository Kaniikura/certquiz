# Implementation Task List - Phase 1 (Simple MVP Architecture)

## Overview

This document breaks down Phase 1 implementation into manageable tasks using a simplified module-based architecture. Each task should be completed with tests before moving to the next.

**Phase 1 Goal**: Basic quiz functionality with authentication and admin features using a simple, module-based structure that can evolve to clean architecture when needed.

## Task Organization

- 🔴 **Blocker**: Must be completed before dependent tasks
- 🟡 **High Priority**: Core functionality
- 🟢 **Normal Priority**: Can be done in parallel
- ⏱️ **Estimated Time**: Rough estimate for completion

## Definition of Done

Each task is complete when:

2. ✅ Tests are written and passing (minimum 80% coverage)
3. ✅ TypeScript has no errors
4. ✅ Code follows project conventions
5. ✅ Performance targets are met
6. ✅ Documentation is updated
7. ✅ Feature works end-to-end

## Revised Timeline

**Note**: Timeline updated to reflect additional setup tasks (1A series) completed during implementation.

- **Week 1**: Tasks 1 + 1A + 2 (Core Setup + Additional Tasks + Shared Utilities)
- **Week 2**: Tasks 3-4 (Database & Modules)
- **Week 3**: Tasks 5-6 (API & Basic Features)
- **Week 4**: Tasks 7-8 (Frontend Implementation)
- **Week 5**: Tasks 9-10 (Admin & Testing)
- **Week 6**: Task 11 (DevOps & Deployment)

**Actual Setup Phase Summary**:
- Original tasks (1.1-1.4): 1.5 hours (as planned)
- Additional tasks (1.5-1.8 + 1A.1): ~8 hours (unplanned but valuable)
- Total setup time: ~9.5 hours vs planned 1.5 hours

Total estimate: ~90-110 hours of development time (reduced with simpler architecture, but including additional setup tasks)

## Critical Path

The following tasks are on the critical path and block other work:
1. Shared Utilities (blocks module development)
2. Database Setup (blocks all data operations)
3. Module Implementation (blocks API routes)
4. API Routes (blocks frontend integration)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Performance Risk**: Add caching only where needed
- **Complexity Risk**: Keep modules simple and focused
- **Over-engineering Risk**: Follow YAGNI principle
- **Migration Risk**: Maintain clear module boundaries for Phase 2
