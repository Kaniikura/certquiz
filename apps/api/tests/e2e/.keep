# End-to-End Tests Directory

This directory will contain E2E tests that test the complete application flow, including:
- Full API workflow tests
- Authentication flow tests
- Quiz session complete flow tests
- Integration with external services

E2E tests differ from integration tests by testing the entire application
from the user's perspective, including all layers and external dependencies.
