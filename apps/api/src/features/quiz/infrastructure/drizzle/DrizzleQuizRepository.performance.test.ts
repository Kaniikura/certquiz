       * PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT VALIDATION
       *
       * Previous Implementation (Phase 1-2):
       * =====================================
       * 1. SELECT all completed quiz sessions from snapshot table
       * 2. For each session, parse JSONB answers in JavaScript
       * 3. For each session, call questionDetailsService.getMultipleQuestionDetails()
       * 4. For each session, call buildAnswerResults() in JavaScript
       * 5. For each session, calculate correctCount in JavaScript
       * 6. For each session, calculate percentage in JavaScript
       * 7. Sum all percentages and divide by count in JavaScript
       *
       * Query Complexity: O(n) database reads + O(n*m) JavaScript processing
       * - n = number of completed quizzes
       * - m = average questions per quiz
       *
       * Network Calls: 1 + n (1 for snapshots, n for question details batches)
       * JavaScript Processing: O(n*m) for scoring calculation
       *
       * New Implementation (Phase 3):
       * =============================
       * 1. Single SQL query with AVG() aggregation on pre-calculated correct_answers
       * 2. PostgreSQL handles the calculation natively
       * 3. Returns single row with average, counts, and metadata
       *
       * Query Complexity: O(1) database aggregation
       * Network Calls: 1 (single aggregation query)
       * JavaScript Processing: O(1) for result parsing
       *
       * EXPECTED PERFORMANCE GAINS:
       * - 95%+ reduction in network calls (from 1+n to 1)
       * - 99%+ reduction in JavaScript processing (from O(n*m) to O(1))
       * - 90%+ reduction in memory usage (no in-memory quiz loading)
       * - Scales linearly O(1) instead of O(n*m) with more quizzes

       * 3. For each row: SELECT question details for scoring
       * 4. For each row: Calculate score in JavaScript
       * 5. For each row: Accumulate for average in JavaScript

       * New Query Pattern (Single Aggregation):
       * =======================================

       *             THEN (correct_answers::float / question_count::float) * 100
